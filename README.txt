Progress on the card game has been hard and can be attributed to the lack of clarity I have for this project


Do what the card says to your score
Go to the card in the arrow
It ends when it ends

score as much as possible

I want the game to feel like a system of connected pipes.

Ideally a deterministic game
you can't reach the same card more than three times

expectations  
score as much as possible 
a piece on the board that goes across a series of cards
the piece can keep score 
the ability to remember the number of times a card has been hit
